# Matrix Operations
Never hustle with Matrix Calculations..! Matrices are central to the study of linear algebra. They enable mathematicians work with many equations with multiple variable in a systematic way. Matrices are also easily readable by computerized systems.

## The Problem

Matrix calculations are easier when we are dealing with 3X3 or some small order of the matrix. And the problem comes when we have to perform operations on a 5X5 or 10X10 matrix. Even simple operations like the addition of matrixes would consume lots of time.

## The Solution
To solve the problem, we decided to develop a website wherein we implemented all the matrix calculations in an easier way. Whether it is a 3X3 or 10X10 matric calculations of the matrix have been made simpler. With the help of world-class HTML5, CSS3 and JS we have developed this site so that performing the operations have been made easier for the user to solve the problem.

## Functions included in the project
1. Addition of mxn matrix with mxn matrix

6. Determinant of mxn matrix
7. Multiplication of a mxn matrix with a number
8. Statics of the functions used


## How to run the project
1. Extract the zip file "matrix_operations.zip"
2. Copy and paste the folder into htdocs 
3. Open up Xampp and strat both Apache server and MySQL database
4. Go PHPMyAdmin and create  a database named "matrix_operations"
4. Import the .sql file from the database folder 
5. Go to localhost/matrix_operations
6. you can find the working project their
